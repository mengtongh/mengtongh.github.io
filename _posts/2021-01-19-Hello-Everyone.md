# Teaching as a graduate student
>I was very fortunate to teach two classes as a graduate student instructor during the first year of my PhD study. I would like to share some of my personal reflection on how to become a better instructor and how to use TAing as an opportunity to sharpen your skills .



>About a year ago, I couldn't think of any situations more nerve wrecking than standing in front of a room of strangers and be the solo speaker for 50 minutes straight. It took great courage to take that first step. I was worried about too much at that moment. Will the students pay attention to what I am talking about? Will the students interact with me when I ask them to? Those are legit concerns for any newcomers in teaching. Those questions also shaped how I prepare myself for each session.


## Introduce yourself with Confidence


>Introducing yourself to students is very critical for making the first impression. Depending on what kind of persona you want to build, you can tailor your speech differently. For me, I wanted to show students my credentials in statistics but not to intimidate them and scare them away from reaching out for help. I also wanted to stress my enthusiasm in helping them. To achieve that, when meeting with undergraduates, I told them how much I missed college though I literally just left college a few months ago. I believe that I made connections with my undergrad crew right there. It's also important to elaborate a little bit on your research or academic background. There were two students who came to me after my first lab and inquired about my journey to graduate school. That was the first time I realized some students view their TAs as exemplary peers who have succeeded in certain fields. I wouldn't go so far on whether students intend to make friends with you but I would say you can be a good influence on them. 


## Create hands-on Content

>A fifty-minute long lab session can be dreary for some of them. Remember not everyone in the room is actually interested in the subject. They might be forced to sit in the room to finish certain requirements for their majors. I found that giving students worksheets and hands-on tasks can be very effective in engaging them in the classroom. You should consult your professor on what to include in your session but it is always a good idea to prepare some not-so-boring activities. At least make it sounds more interesting than the back of chapter exercise in the textbooks. There are tricks I learned from my professors on building contents. 1. Putting examples and exercises in relevant context. Know what interests your students and try to fit your examples in that context.

> 2. Turning hypothetical scenarios into reality. May it be simple simulation or real time experiments, you can recreate some of the textbook definition by giving them a concrete example and let them be part of it.

> 3. Focusing on the exam material. As a student, I know how annoying it is to ask " will this be on the test" type of questions, but I still couldn't help but asking repeatedly. Students are eager to know what will be on the test. They tend to think you have good connections with the professors and want to get first-hand information from you. To make the life of all of us easy, we should always consider preparing materials that are test relevant. 


## Have small talks with students 

> For me, having small talks with students eases some of the awkwardness between us. Ask them about their days or their classes. It helps me get to know some of the students and generally makes my teaching experience more fun. When you know the people you are teaching, you will be more motivated to know whether they grasp the ideas or not. Also, it is helpful for checking on my own performances. Did I make myself clear to students. I like to directly ask my students. Does that make sense to you? Should I explain this concept a little bit more? In the end, you will be benefited from this interaction because they can guide you on how to be a better public speaker. 


## Build relationship with your professor

I was very lucky to work with one of the most understanding professors I ever met. He knows what students want which to me was a big advantage. When students genuinely enjoy their instructors, they will be less picky on TAs.  While working as a team, you get to have numerous opportunities to interact with your professor who is very likely to be a different person from your thesis advisor. It is always nice to have someone know you well in the department. I always position myself as a learner. I payed particular attention in class on the pedagogy the professor utilizes. I was able to observe how students react to different strategies applied in each class.



For me, being a TA as a graduate student is more than grading homework and holding office hours. While grading is pretty tough and I am not going to deny that, you can certainly make your teaching experience unique and enjoyable if you put in a little bit thought.
